# App Layout Angular

## Motivation

This is the second challenge from react module of master frontend of Lemoncode. Proposal was to do small cart shopping and use Context API from react to make it state avalaible in components who need it. No matter how deep in tree they are.

## First Steps

This project was generated with create-react-app 5.0.

To install dependencies you need to execute

```
npm install
```

To start development server you need to execute and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`

```
npm start
```

## Learnings

- Context API.
- Material UI. How to use it and style components.
- Think in React: Get comfortable to check a design and divide it by component.
